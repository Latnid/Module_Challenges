# Crypto Clustering

In this analyzer, I combine my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills.
Including the following step:
* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results

# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -J upyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.Open source, commercially usable - BSD license
