## Venture Funding with Deep Learning

In this study, I use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. 
The steps for this study are broken out into the following sections:

Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

Optimize the neural network model.


# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -J upyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.Open source, commercially usable - BSD license
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An end-to-end machine learning platform. Find solutions to accelerate machine learning tasks at every stage of your workflow.

Installation Guide

Install the app's dependencies first.

```
  pip install pandas
  pip install -U scikit-learn
