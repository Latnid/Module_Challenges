# Machine Learning Trading Bot

In this Challenge, I combined my new AWS skills with myexisting Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -J upyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
