# Pychain

In this Challenge, I complete the code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I assumed the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.

* [web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/) - Web3.py is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum.

* [bip44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) - Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 44 defines the standard derivation path for wallets which generate Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses. BIP 44 also defines the prefixes to be used with associated extended keys.

# Installation Guide
