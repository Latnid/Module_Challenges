#  Loan Qualifier Application

Users may use this Python command-line interface program to sort qualified loans according to a number of criteria. The program functions by importing a "daily rate sheet" of loan requirements from different loan providers. Users may also decide whether and where to store the lenders' filtered data on qualified loans as a .CSV file.
