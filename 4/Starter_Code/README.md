# Risk return analysis

We use different metrics to evaluate four new investment funds. The four new investment funds are BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC, PAULSON & CO.INC, and SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC. We are using metrics to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [pathlib](https://github.com/budlight/pathlib) - pathlib offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths. 

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)-JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionalit
