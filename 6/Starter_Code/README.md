# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [pathlib](https://github.com/budlight/pathlib) - pathlib offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths. 
* [hvplot.pandas](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/)
* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)-JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionalit
