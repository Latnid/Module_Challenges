# ETF Analyzer
In this analyzer, I build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and the associated packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.

* [hvplot.pandas](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.

* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -J upyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

* [voila](https://pypi.org/project/voila/) - Rendering of live Jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets.
